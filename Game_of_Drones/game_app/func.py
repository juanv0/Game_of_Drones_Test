"""
Function to implement the matricial cross product wich is used to give te result
of scissor (s) vs rock (r) vs paper (p), it work like this:
s vs p = r vs s = p vs r = 1, this means the first element wins the round
p vs s = s vs r = r vs p = -1, this means the last element wins the round 
Note: I assume that each element is a orthogonal vector in 3-dimension as
s = [1,0,0], p = [0,1,0], r = [0,0,1] so the crossÂ´product give this result,
further reading about cross product could be found at any linear algebra book
